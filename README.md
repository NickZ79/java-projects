# java-projects# Java Projects

A collection of Java projects and exercises I’ve built while learning software development.  
Most of these started as school assignments, but I treat them like real-world practice for writing clean, maintainable code.

## Projects

### 1. Pizza Builder (OOP & Testing)
- **Summary:** A console-based app that builds pizzas from a list of ingredients, calculates prices, and runs test cases to verify different pizza combinations.
- **Concepts:** Input validation, methods, arithmetic operations, encapsulation, string formatting, modular program structur
- **Folder:** `pizza_maker/`

### 2. [loan calculator]
- **Summary:** A Java console program that calculates monthly loan payments based on user-entered amount, interest rate, and term. It outputs formatted amortization details and demonstrates basic math operations and user input handling.
- **Concepts:** e.g., file I/O, inheritance, interfaces, collections, etc.
- **Folder:** `loan_calculator/`



> As I continue through my degree, I’ll add more Java projects here to track my progress and show how my code evolves over time.

## How to Run These Projects

Each project lives in its own folder with a `README.md` that explains:

- What the project does
- How to compile and run it
- Any sample input / expected output

In general:

```bash
# From inside a project folder
javac *.java
java Main
